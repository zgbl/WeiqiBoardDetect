# WeiqiBoardDetect

Project start at Jun 13, 2025

This project applies computer vision techniques to detect the grid and stones of a physical Weiqi(Go/Baduk) board from an image. It uses OpenCV and Python to convert a perspective view into a top-down projection, detect the grid lines, and locate the 19x19 intersection points where moves happen.
